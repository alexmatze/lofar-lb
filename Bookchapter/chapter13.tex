\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The prime reason to include the international LOFAR stations in the array is to
obtain very high-resolution images.  Using the longest LOFAR baselines,
subarcsecond imaging is possible in the HBA band and the upper part of the LBA
band. Early science results include detailed images of AGN jets, and imaging of
individual supernova remnants in M82. In this chapter we describe the array
properties, the interferometric regime of International LOFAR, and we describe
some calibration and imaging pecularities. We explain some Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) techniques and other practical considerations required to
properly calibrate the international stations. Some of the discussions will be
focused on the LOFAR HBA; calibration and imaging of long baseline data from
LBA stations is more challenging and still need additional testing and
optimization.


\section{International LOFAR stations}
The majority of the LOFAR stations, namely the core and remote stations, are
distributed over an area roughly 180 km in diameter predominantly in the
northeastern Dutch province of Drenthe. Currently, the array also includes 8
international LOFAR stations across Europe that provide maximum baselines up to
1292~km. One additional station has recently been installed in Hamburg (Germany)
in 2014, and three stations in Poland will commence construction in 2014,
extending the maximum baseline to $\sim$2000~km. Fig.~\ref{fig:stations} shows
the distribution of current and planned stations of International LOFAR.

Observations with the LOFAR international stations are different from the Dutch
array observations in that the number of stations providing baselines above
120~km is scarce, yielding a less dense uv-coverage, that the instrument has a
reduced field of view (FoV), and that the atmospheric conditions above each
station are highly uncorrelated, making the phase calibration much more
delicate. Another (current) difference is that a catalogue of compact sourcesat
frequencies below 300~MHz does not exist, and no accurate models of the compact
structure of flux calibrators is available.

\subsection{uv-coverage}\label{sec:uvcoverage}

The maximum baseline of an interferometer determines the spatial resolution of
the instrument. The core stations provide maximum baselines of 2.7~km, the
remote stations of 120~km, and the international stations of 1300~km.
Table~\ref{tab:baselines} shows the distances between each pair of
international stations, and we include CS001 as a reference of the location of
the center of the array.  Besides the maximum baseline, the density of
visibilities in the $uv$ space determines the fidelity of the image. The LOFAR
core provides a very dense $uv$ sampling, but at the longest $uv$ distances it
is much more scarce.  A typical LOFAR $uv$ coverage is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:uvcoverage}. We can see that the LOFAR coverage spans three
orders of magnitude in $uv$ distance.

\subsection{Field of view (FoV) and averaging}\label{sec:fov}

The area possible to image in a single LOFAR observation (NL or international)
is limited by several factors such as the station beam, geometrical/projection
effects, W-projection artefacts, variations in the atmosphere within the image,
and averaging of visibility data, also referred to as time and frequency
\emph{smearing}. The latter is mainly important for long baselines and in this
section we describe this effect in more detail. 

Since correlators output a discrete set of visibilities (i.e. samples in time
and frequency), averaging is to some extent always done on interferometric
data. We may also average the data further after correlation to reduce the
computational resources needed for calibration and imaging. Any averaging must
however be done with care.  Averaging a range of samples in time and frequency
together corresponds to averaging over a small parallelogram in Fourier space.
This means some information is lost, and one has to take care to not lose
information that could affect the scientific results. For LOFAR, the standard
\emph{raw} data are delivered from the correlator with resolution 1 second in
time, and 64 channels per subband.  Each subband (using the standard 200\,MHz
clock) is 195\,kHz wide, meaning that the default minimum averaging bandwidth
is 3~kHz. This will limit the dynamic range at some distance from the observed
phase center, similar to the station beam effects described above.  A detailed
description of the averaging losses is beyond the scope of this chapter, we
merely quote the often used results by \cite{taylor99} chapter 18, who derived
two expressions to estimate the average amplitude loss due to averaging in
frequency and time, at some distance from the phase center.  For frequency
smearing, we can use their expression 18-24 assuming a square bandpass and
circular Gaussian tapering, where the reduction in amplitude at a distance from
the phase centre $r$ can be estimated as

\begin{equation}
\frac{I}{I_0} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2\sqrt{\ln{2}}}\frac{\theta \nu_c}{r \Delta
\nu}\mathrm{erf}\left(\sqrt{\ln{2}}\frac{r \Delta\nu}{\theta \nu_c}\right)
\label{eqn:freqloss}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\theta$ is the synthesized beam size (FWHM), $\nu_c$ is the central
frequency of the observation, and $\Delta \nu$ is the bandwidth. Note that the
units of $\theta$ and $r$ cancel if they are given in the same unit. Note also
that this expression is in fact independent of central frequency $\nu_c$ since
the synthesised beam also scales with $\nu_c$, only the bandwidth is important.

For time smearing, we may use their formula 18-43, assuming a 12 hour average
over a circular UV-coverage with Gaussian tapering:

\begin{equation}
\frac{I}{I_0} = 1-1.22\times 10^{-9}\left(\frac{r}{\theta}\right)^2\Delta t^2
\label{eqn:timeloss}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is the averaging time in seconds.

What loss to define as acceptable of course depends on your science, in
particular the brightness of your target, but as a general guide one may
tolerate 5\% loss in amplitude due to averaging. Using the standard LOFAR raw
data values, we have calculated the corresponding circle (diameter, to compare
with station FWHM) for different observing frequencies, see Table
\ref{tab:res}. We note that, except for the lowest LBA frequencies, we are
limited by time averaging, where the 5\% loss diameter is smaller than the
station beam. Note that this limitation is not present for shorter baselines
for which $\theta$ is larger, and usually not a cause for worry in NL-LOFAR
observations. But, with the longest baselines, the main restriction may (if you
need excellent sensitivity) be the averaging by the raw data.

\subsection{Differential delay: cause and effects}

The interferometric phase depends on the time delay of the signal to reach two
different stations. In particular, the phase delay is
$\tau_{\phi}=\frac{\phi}{2\pi\nu}$, which means that any delay between two
stations will produce a change in the interferometric phase as a funcion of
frequency.  We note that, since the phases are always relative to a reference
station, the delay contribution comes from the differential delay between two
stations. There are different contributions to the delay: on the geometry of
the stations with respect to the observed source (geometric delay,
$\tau_{g}=\vec{B}\cdot\vec{s}/c$, where $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{s}$ are the
baseline vector and the direction of the source, respectively), instrumental
effects (instrumental delay), and propagation of the signal through the
atmosphere (ionospheric delay, see below). If the model applied during
correlation were perfect, all stations would see a delay offset of zero for an
isolated compact source, but deviations are produced by several factors. First,
errors in station positions (and currently at a much lower level errors in the
the Earth orientation parameters, EOPs) used by the correlator produce
variability of about $\pm75$~ns with a 24~h periodicity.  The current
correlator model used by LOFAR is insufficiently accurate, and this source of
error can be expected to be greatly reduced in the near future.  Instabilities
in the rubidium clocks can produce delay rates up to 20 ns per 20 min, which
corresponds to about a radian per minute at 150~MHz \citep{vanhaarlem13}.  In
total, non-dispersive instrumental delays of up to $\sim100$~ns and delay rates
of up to $\sim$20~ns~h$^{-1}$ are expected.  Second, for any given source,
errors in the {\em a priori} centroid position (for example from low-frequency
catalogues, with a typical error of a few arcseconds) and/or extended structure
on subarcsecond scales add an additional delay offset.  The maximum baseline
between an international station and the LOFAR core is 700 km (see
Table~\ref{tab:baselines}); a positional error of 1.5$^{\prime\prime}$ will
lead to a delay error of $\sim$15 ns on this baseline.

The ionospheric contribution to the delay changes as a function of time,
position, and zenith angle.  The magnitude of the changes depend on the Total
Electron Content (TEC) of the ionosphere, with a delay of $\tau_{\rm
ion}=c^{2}r_{\rm e}/(2\pi\nu^{2})\times {\rm TEC}$, being $c$ the speed of
light, $r_{\rm e}$ the classical electron radius, and $\nu$ the observed
frequency. The TEC, usually measured in TEC Units (1${\rm
TECU}=10^{16}$~electrons~m$^{-2}$), can be estimated using models derived from
observations of GPS satellites.  Models are available from different
institutes, such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Center for Orbit
Determination in Europe (CODE), the ESOC Ionosphere Monitoring Facility (ESA),
or the Royal Observatory of Belgium GNSS, among others. The models contain
information on the vertical total electron content (VTEC) during an
observations. We note that the TEC values above the stations are a lower limit
of the slant ionospheric contribution that depends on the source elevation at
each station. More details can be found in, for instance, \cite{nigl07} and
\cite{sotomayor13a}.

Although the VTEC follows a 24-h trend strongly correlated with the Sun
elevation, the short-term (10--60 minute) variations between the widely
separated international stations are virtually uncorrelated.  The ionospheric
contribution typically dominates the total delay and delay rate for
international LOFAR stations. Even after a complete phase calibration, the
residual ionospheric delays between the calibrator and the target source can be
important. We have used VLBI observations (VLBA project code BD152) at 300~MHz,
or 1~m wavelength, of bright and compact pulsars at different angular
separations to obtain a rough estimate of the delay difference between sources
separated 1--5~degrees at elevations of 50--80$^{\circ}$. As a first
approximation we estimated that the dispersive delay difference between sources
at different lines of sight should be about 5~ns per degree of separation, for
a source elevation of 60$^{\circ}$.

Finally, the determination of the delays will be limited by the brightness of
the source used to calibrate them, and the sensitivity of the station. In
summary, in a normal observation phase uncertainties are caused by source
position and structure errors, differential ionosphere, uncorrected
instrumental delays, and noise. Table~\ref{tab:expecteddelay} summarises the
main contributions and the time scale in which they change.

\section{Long baseline calibration}
\label{sec:calibration}

Calibration of the international stations poses a special challenge compared to
LOFAR observations with the Dutch array, and these can be addressed using tools
developed for cm~wavelength VLBI.  The calibration process must derive the
station-based amplitude and phase corrections in the direction of the target
source with adequate accuracy as a function of time. 

\subsection{Phase calibration}
Due to the large and time-variable delay offsets at each station, solving for
phase corrections directly (approximating the correction as constant over a
given solution time and bandwidth) would require very narrow solution intervals
for VLBI, and hence an extremely bright calibrator source ($\gtrsim10$~Jy).
However, such a source would be unlikely to be close on the sky to the target.
With a separation of perhaps tens of degrees the differential
atmosphere/ionosphere between the calibrator and the target direction would
render the derived calibration useless in the target direction. We can make use
of fainter calibrators closer to the target with the VLBI phase calibrator
known as fring fitting: simultaneously solving for 3 parameters (phase,
non-dispersive delay, and phase rate) in each solution interval, allowing the
solution duration and bandwidth to be greatly extended.  This approach makes a
number of assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The change of delay resulting from dispersion is negligible,
so the total delay can be approximated as a constant across the solution
bandwidth;
\item The change in delay over the solution time can be approximated in a linear
fashion;
\item The change in phase over the solution bandwidth due to the change in delay
over the solution time is small (since the time variation is approximated with a
phase rate, rather than a delay rate).
\end{enumerate}

Meeting these assumptions requires that the solution interval and bandwidth be
kept relatively small, which is at odds with the desire to maximise sensitivity,
which demands that the solution interval and bandwidth be as large as possible.

For 110--240~MHz (LOFAR High Band) observations on long baselines, the
approximations made when solving for phase, phase rate, and non-dispersive delay
fail badly when applied to bandwidths of tens of MHz or more.  Two options
present themselves: to add additional parameters (covering dispersive delay and
dispersive delay rate) to the global fit, or to reduce the solution bandwidth
such that the constant dispersive delay approximation becomes valid again.  The
former option is obviously preferable from a sensitivity perspective, but
greatly expands and complicates the solution search space.  Efforts are underway
to implement such an expanded fit, including in addition differential Faraday
rotation, which becomes increasingly important at frequencies below 100 MHz.
First tests on individual long baselines of LOFAR as well as baselines to other
telescopes are promising, but the algorithms are not yet sufficiently mature for
automatic calibration.  Accordingly, we focus here on sources which can serve as
primary calibrators under the latter set of conditions, where solution
bandwidths are limited to no more than a few MHz.

The system equivalent flux density (SEFD) of a single LOFAR core station is
approximately 1500~Jy\footnote{A LOFAR core station consists of two
sub-stations ($2\times24$ tiles) in the HBA.} at a frequency of $\sim$140~MHz
\citep{vanhaarlem13}.  An international station has twice the collecting area
of a core station at $\sim$140~MHz, so the expected SEFD is around 750 Jy.  The
24 core stations can be coherently combined into a single phased array with an
SEFD of $\sim$65~Jy, in the absence of correlated noise (i.e., when the
observed field only contains sources significantly fainter than the station
SEFD).  The theoretical 1$\sigma$ baseline sensitivity of an international
station to the phased-up core station, given 3~MHz of bandwidth and 4 minutes
of observing time, is hence 8~mJy in a single polarisation.  A source with a
compact flux density of 50~mJy yields a theoretical baseline signal-to-noise
ratio of 6, and is therefore a potential primary calibrator. In the real world,
the sensitivity of the phased-up core station will be reduced by failing tiles,
imperfect calibration and correlated (astronomical) noise, and solution
intervals shorter than 4 minutes could be required under not optimal
ionospheric conditions.  Therefore, 50~mJy should be considered a lower limit
for a useful primary calibrator flux density, being 100--150~mJy a reasonable
reference.

In addition to being sufficiently bright, the primary calibrator must be close
enough to the secondary calibrator/target field that the differential delay
between the two fields does not lead to decorrelation when phase-only secondary
calibration is performed (just as for cm~VLBI).  The solution bandwidths are
narrower by a factor of $\gtrsim$10 than for cm~VLBI, which is helpful, but the
ionospheric delay (inversely proportional to observing frequency squared) is
much greater, meaning that on balance a calibrator closer than the $\lesssim$5
degrees typical for cm~VLBI will be needed.  The maximum acceptable separation
will be a strong function of ionospheric conditions and elevation, but at face
value, given a bandwidth 20 times narrower (e.g., 3 MHz vs 64 MHz) and
frequency 10 times lower (140 MHz vs 1400 MHz), one would expect that the
calibrator would need to be separated by $\lesssim$1 degree.  This is borne out
by commissioning observations with LOFAR, which have shown acceptable results
with separations up to several degrees in favourable ionospheric conditions,
and unacceptable results with separations as small as $\sim$0.8 degrees in poor
conditions.  Ideally, then, a primary calibrator for International LOFAR
observations would be located $\lesssim$1 degree from the secondary
calibrator/target field to give acceptable calibration under most
circumstances. Exploration of the distribution of compact sources at 140~MHz
has shown that the density of calibrators on the sky could be enough to
overcome this restriction \citep{moldon15}. This leads to the one calibration
advantage of International LOFAR compared to cm~VLBI; since the beam of an
International LOFAR station is $\gtrsim$2 degrees across, the primary
calibrator will by necessity be observed contemporaneously with the target
source.

Currently, no specific LOFAR tools for solving for the phases, delays and rates
are available. The best approach is to conduct the phase calibration (or at
least the delay calibration using the primary calibrator) of an International
LOFAR observation with AIPS\footnote{http://www.aips.nrao.edu/index.shtml}
\citep{greisen03a}, produced and maintained by NRAO, using the fringe fitting
task FRING. More information can be found in Section~\ref{sec:aips}.

observation (the first segment of project LC0\_026). It is clear from the rates
and phases that phases changes rapidly during the first and last hours of the
experiment. The delay solutions are more stable, although there is a large
change during the first hour. In general, the ionosphere is more stable during
midnight than at sunset or sunrise.  }

\subsection{Amplitude calibration}

The amplitude calibration requires finding the station gain factors that scale
the raw response of each station to the real flux density measured.  These
scaling factors can be found calibrating the data with a bright source with
known flux density and structure (for example a point-like calibrator).  For
core and remote stations one can use, for example, bright sources in low
frequency catalogs such as MSSS \citep{heald14}. However, for International
LOFAR that is in general not possible because (1) there is not yet a
high resolution source catalogue, and therefore the structure of bright sources
is unknown at these scales, (2) the international stations sample only very long
$uv$ distances (see Fig.~\ref{fig:uvcoverage}, right panel) that not overlap
with the shorter baselines that can be corrected, and (3) compact and bright
regions of potential calibrators, usually AGN, are expected to change with
time. In principle, instrumental gains within LOFAR could be tracked with time
(this option is currently being commissioning with the COBALT correlator), but
since this option is not yet available, making a sufficiently  accurate a
priori calibration is also not feasible. Therefore, the current approach
requires to self-calibrate a bright calibrator to find its small-scale
structure, and bootstrap its flux density between the long and the short
baselines, assuming that the low-resolution flux density of the source is
stable and known. 

For a science observation, it is recommended to include runs on very a bright
and known calibrator (for instance 3C196 or 3C84) and a compact source
(for instance a cm-VLBI calibrator or a bright pulsar) to set the amplitude
scale, and link the short/long-baselines flux density, respectively. We
note that a proper amplitude calibration requires also a good model of the
spectral index of the reference calibrator.  

After a phase and amplitude calibration of an International LOFAR observation,
the resulting visibilities should look similar to the ones shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:radplot}, where we show the calibrator J0958+6533 used in
\cite{varenius15}.

dataset of J0958+6533. This calibrator has a very compact component of 0.5~Jy,
mainly unresolved with the longest LOFAR baselines. We can see how the shorter
baselines are sensitive to a much more complex structure and possibly other
sources in the field.}

\end{figure*}


\section{Practical considerations}
\label{sec:practical}

\subsection{Shift+average}\label{sec:shift}

Given the high resolution obtained with the International LOFAR observations,
imaging of the region restricted by the time and frequency average of the data
(see Table~\ref{tab:res}) would require a very high computational cost. If one
is interested in multiple objects within the station beam, one can phase-shift
(and re-project) the $uv$-data to each object before averaging.  After
correlation, the full-resolution visibility dataset can be shifted and averaged
multiple times, to the positions of all the target sources and possibly to one
or more nearby calibrators. Starting in cycle four, it will be possible to
request shifting and averaging of data to multiple phase centers within a beam
as a part of a normal observation.

\subsection{Distributing bandwidth on different sources}\label{sec:bandwidth}

It is possible to distribute LOFAR bandwidth over a number of beams to
simultaneously observe different regions of the sky. In particular, it is
possible to divide the bandwidth on target(s) and calibrator, which provides a
continuous source calibration without the need of regularly nodding from target
to calibrator. Another possibility is to distribute the bandwidth among a large
number of sources to search for suitable calibrators. For example one can
generate 30 beams to observe simultaneously 30 sources with 3~MHz bandwith as a
fast way to search for suitable compact calibrators for an
International LOFAR observation \citep[see i.e.][]{moldon15}

To optimize the observation it is possible to use fewer subbands on the
calibrator, and thereby get more subbands, i.e. lower continuum noise, on the
target beam. To use fringe finding, we need to sample accurately the residual
delay/rate slope (and possibly curvature at low frequencies) present in the
data. This can be done with sparse sampling in frequency, where the optimal
coverage is achieved by spreading the subbands as a powerlaw density with
denser placement of subbands at lower frequencies \citep{marti-vidal10}. The
advantage of this approach is that more bandwidth can be placed on the target.
The disadvantage is that the calibration becomes a bit more demanding. One
reason for this is that the UVFITS format used by AIPS (for running fringe
fitting) requires data in all channels.  If we do not have contiguous subband
coverage in frequency, we need to insert fake data and flag that (e.g. using
NDPPP) before reading the data into AIPS.  This will cause an increase in data
volume which will slow down processing.  Also, spreading the subbands sparsely
is always a risk in case your calibrator is weaker than you think. A detailed
discussion can be found in \cite{marti-vidal10}, where the authors analyse how
to distribute subbands specifically for LOFAR observations for optimal fringe
detection.

\subsection{Form a combined station}

The huge difference between the $uv$ distances provided by core-core baselines
and international baselines makes it very difficult to produce images where the
very compact and the very diffuse emission can be analysed together. When
studying the compact structure of a source, the shortest baselines do not add
too much information whereas they difficult the calibration, for example
because they are sensitive to potentially hundreds of bright sources in a
bigger area of the sky. The core stations can be added to form a coherent
``tied station'' (TS001) that keeps the core sensitivity and the long baselines
to the international stations.  Since the core stations are under similar
atmospheric conditions and they share the same clock only slow changes in their
amplitudes and phases are expected, and thus they can be calibrated by
observing a bright primary calibrator once every $\sim1$~hr. TS001 can be
formed by summing baseline visibilities with the NDPPP task ``StationAdder''.
After this step, all original visibilities with core-core baselines can be
discarded using the NDPPP task ``Filter'' to significantly reduce the data
volume.

One important benefit of having a tied station is that it works as a very
sensitive station. This tied-array station aids in the derivation of
calibration solutions to the international stations with FRING, and can be used
as a reference station. We note that a tied-station formed by adding the whole
core has a very small (5\% amplitude loss at 30$''$ distance from phase center)
field of view. Although this is rarely a problem for deriving FRING solutions,
care is needed if using such combined data to image extended objects.

%In Fig.~\ref{fig:CSvsTS} we show calibrated amplitudes and phases for some
%baselines from some remote stations to a single core station and to the tied
%station formed by coherently combining 23 core stations.

%\end{figure}


\subsection{Linear to circular polarization}

Differential Faraday rotation introduces rapid phase changes with frequency
into linear polarisation data on long baselines. For long-baseline observations
is preferable to work in a circular (R,L) polarisation basis. In this basis,
the ionospheric disturbances are transformed from coupled amplitude/phase
effects (as in the linear X,Y basis) to phase only effects. Since differential
Faraday rotation does not mix R and L polarisations we may calibrate RR and LL
independently. Furthermore, standard VLBI techniques like fringe fitting work
in a circular (R,L) polarisation basis. Therefore, the data have to be
converted to circular polarisation before the phase calibration of the long
baselines.

Conversion to circular polarisation can be done using the Table Query Language
(TAQL) to operate on the measurement set data directly. We note that the
effects of the station beam should be calibrated with BBS before converting the
data. As the effects of the station beam were already calibrated, this is a
simple operation. However, we note that since BBS calibrates the XX and YY
components independently, an overall phase-offset between X and Y may remain.
Another tool to convert from linear to circular polarisation is
\emph{mscorpol}, developed by T. D. Carozzi.


% JM: it is recommended to use BBS corrections + taql conversion over mscorpol. The main reason is because eventually the beam model in BBS should be more accurate. Other reasons are that they are official LOFAR tools, that will probably get more maintenance, and have some additions, such as accounting for failing tiles, etc.  
% EV: The beam model problems in LOFAR seem to be so serious at the moment that
% I cannot recommend anyone using that route if they want to get reliable results.
% Unfortunately, I think we need a very firm testing of the LOFAR beam models
% before we can reccommend this kind of procedure. 
% I understand the politically correct point of view, but explicitly reccomending
% a system which may cause serious errors feels wrong.

%The M82 data \cite{varenius2014} were converted from linear to circular using
%the tool \emph{mscorpol} v1.6, developed by T. D. Carozzi.  This tool
%includes corrections for dipole-projection effects as a function of the
%correlated sky position relative to all included LOFAR stations.  After the
%conversion, the data are circularly polarised, with full (but approximated)
%parallactic angle correction. 

\subsection{Convert to UVFITS}

Since AIPS understands the UVFITS-format, but not Measurement Sets (MS)
we need to convert the data from MS to UVFITS. There are several ways to do this:
\begin{itemize}
\item You may use the tool \emph{ms2uvfits} available at the LOFAR cluster, as {\tt ms2uvfits in=[input-MS] out=[output-FITS-file] writesyscal=False}
\item You may use the function \emph{exportuvfits} in CASA.
\end{itemize}
Note that in a UVFITS file there must be data for all baselines included,
although data can be flagged if baselines are bad. If one tries to reduce data
size by exluding particular subarrays with NDPPP one may run into very strange
errors in AIPS, since the basic assumptions of UVFITS are not valid.  Hence, it
is important to ensure that data are contiguous in frequency (e.g. by inserting
fake data as explained in Sect.~\ref{sec:bandwidth}) and that there are data
present for all baselines in the dataset. 

The AIPS task FITLD can be used to load the data in to AIPS. For LOFAR data,
the parameters digicor=-1 and douvcomp=-1 should be used. Task INDXR is needed
to create an initial calibration table. FIXWT is needed to correctly scale the
data weights.


\subsection{Brief introduction to calibration tables in AIPS}\label{sec:aips}

In AIPS one calibrates data by sucessively finding and improving corrections
for the amplitude and phase of visibilites. These corrections are stored in
tables.  Each correction derived is store in an `SN' table, and the cumulative
corrections are stored in a `CL' table. The SN table will have a resolution
which you specify for each task, i.e. if you find corrections averaging data in
two minute chunks, the SN table will have one value every two minutes. The CL
table may have a different granularity, so that when applying a specific SN
table, you may (automatically) interpolate to CL-table entries between the SN
entries. When you are done with calibration, your data can be multiplied by the
CL table  that includes all the corrections using the task SPLIT to produce a
UVFITS file with the corrected data.

\section{Finding calibrators}\label{findcalib}

Until a good catalogue of compact sources at MHz frequencies is available, it
is important to take into account that a science observation might require a
preparatory search of calibrators. A fast method using the distribution of
bandwidth between many sources (see Sect.~\ref{sec:bandwidth}) is described in
\cite{moldon15}. A pre-selection based on a number of parameters from existing
catalogues, such as the low-frequency spectral index, and the flux, ca be
performed to optimize the search. In particular the most useful catalogues are
the VLSS, at 74~MHz, 4~m wavelength \citep{lane12a}, the WENSS catalogue at
325~MHz, 92 cm wavelength \citep{rengelink97}, and specially The Multifrequency
Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS), which comes from LOFAR observations
\citep{heald14}. 

\cite{moldon15} showed that there is a density of $\sim1$ good calibrator per
square degree based on two fields with Galactic latitudes of $+26.6^{\circ}$
and $+43.4^{\circ} $. However, we expect less compact sources at lower Galactic
latitudes due to interstellar scattering. The Galactic electron density model
NE2001 \citep{cordes02} predicts an scattering at a galactic latitude of
$50^{\circ}$ of almost 100~mas at 150~MHz, which is five times smaller than our
resolution. However, the scattering is about 300~mas, similar to our beamsize,
at latitudes of 5--10$^{\circ}$, depending on the longitude. Therefore,
observations below a Galactic latitude of 10$^{\circ}$ are likely to be
affected by scattering on the longest baselines, and the effect should be
severe below about 2$^{\circ}$, especially towards the Galactic Center. 

\section{Observing strategy}

For cm VLBI, the dispersive delay due to the ionosphere is small (and so are
the changes with time), meaning that solution intervals of minutes and widths
of tens to hundreds of MHz are generally permissible.  After application of the
solutions from the primary calibrator it is common to use a secondary
calibrator\footnote{A secondary calibrator is often referred to as an
``in-beam'' calibrator in VLBI if it is close enough to the target source to be
observed contemporaneously} closer to the target source (separation
$\sim$arcmin), or to use the target source if it is bright enough for
``self-calibration'', solving only for the phase (no delay or rate). This
second phase-only calibration is used to refine the calibration errors that
result from the spatial or temporal interpolation of the primary solutions.
Because this is a problem with fewer degrees of freedom, lower signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) data can be used.  Additionally, because the bulk delay has already
been removed, even more bandwidth can be combined in a single solution for a
further improvement in S/N.  A secondary calibrator can therefore be
considerably fainter (usually $\sim$1-10 mJy versus $>$100 mJy for a primary
calibrator).  This typical VLBI calibration strategy is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:calstrategy}.

\begin{figure*}[] %figure1

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/vlbi_sketch.pdf}
%}
\caption{Typical calibration setup for cm VLBI (left) and International LOFAR
(right).  Note that in some cases the target may itself function as the
secondary calibrator.  A secondary calibrator is not always required for cm
VLBI, but will almost always be needed for International LOFAR, unless the
primary calibrator is fortuitously close.  The larger field of view of LOFAR
means that both the primary and secondary calibrators will always be observed
contemporaneously, unlike in cm VLBI, where nodding between the primary
calibrator and target is typically required (shown by the double arrow in the
left panel).}
\label{fig:calstrategy}
\end{figure*}


\cite{moldon15} proposed the following approach for an International LOFAR observation: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify candidate primary calibrators up to separations of a few degrees 
    by using any of the criteria discussed in Sect.~5.3 in
    \cite{moldon15};
\item Conduct a short observation in snapshot mode as described
in Sect.~\ref{findcalib} before the science observation to identify
the best primary calibrator (or calibrators).
\item If required and time permits, follow up with a ``full bandwidth'' snapshot observation to 
identify one or more secondary calibrators;
\item Set up the scientific observation to dwell on the field 
containing the primary calibrator and the target/secondary calibrator;
\item Include periodic scans (every $\sim$ hour) on a bright Dutch array 
calibrator to calibrate the core stations in order to form the tied station.
\item Shift phase centre to primary calibrator, preprocess and obtain delay solutions 
as described in this paper, apply them to the unshifted dataset;
\item If a secondary calibrator is to be used and is not yet identified, select 10 minutes
of data and perform shift/averaging to candidate secondary calibrator sources;
\item If secondary calibrator is used: shift and average primary-calibrated dataset, 
image and selfcalibrate, apply solutions to the unshifted dataset;
\item Shift and average calibrated dataset, image and (if needed) selfcalibrate target.
\end{enumerate}

In the near future, the pipeline used for this project will be developed, in
collaboration with the LOFAR operations team, into an expanded form capable of
carrying out the approach described above.  This pipeline will be made available
to all International LOFAR observers, delivering a reduced data volume for
long-baseline observations and enabling calibrated data to be more quickly
produced.

Finally, in Fig.~\ref{fig:final} we show an example of a high resolution image
of M82 produced using International LOFAR combined with a low-resolution LOFAR
image showing the diffuse emission of M82 \cite{varenius15}.
